This is a standalone windows browser that allows you to package your entire web application. 
It supports HTML5, CSS 3, Javascript, as well as PHP 7.0 and MySQL 5.7.


How it works:
It does not need an installation, you just run it directly from a pc, you can even run from your flashdrive. 
And it does not conflict with regular servers like wamp or other apache server.

Once the browser loads, it starts its internal php server and displays the default index.php almost immediately.

Developers Info:
- The browser links to its internal homepage with a link like http://localhost:8181/index.php. 
- The MySQL port number here is 3318 by default, database username is root and no password. 
- The index.php for is located inside the \support\inetpub - this is where to start your application development.
- You can do almost all your configurations from core/package.js at the root folder of the installation
- You can configure mysql, apache and php by checking the config folder at the root of the installation
